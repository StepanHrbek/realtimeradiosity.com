<b>Realtime Global Illumination Demos</b>, demos with
advanced realtime computed illumination.
It's not strictly limited to physically correct global illumination,
specific techniques may approximate GI or compute only subset of GI;
such solutions may be faster and more suitable for realtime rendering.
What's important is that these demos compute and render more than is usual,
so they show possible future of mainstream realtime renderering.
